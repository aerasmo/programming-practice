# Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.
# As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(

# So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1, 1, 1] as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:
# [1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]

# But what if we started with [0, 0, 1] as a signature? As starting with [0, 1] instead of [1, 1] basically shifts the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:
# [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]

# test.assert_equals(tribonacci([1, 1, 1], 10), [1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, 57, 105])
# test.assert_equals(tribonacci([0, 0, 1], 10), [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44])
# test.assert_equals(tribonacci([0, 1, 1], 10), [0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81])
# test.assert_equals(tribonacci([1, 0, 0], 10), [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24])
# test.assert_equals(tribonacci([0, 0, 0], 10), [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
